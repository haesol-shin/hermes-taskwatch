# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in hermes-taskwatch. The rules are short.

## Before you start

- Open an issue to report a bug or to propose work you are not going to implement yourself.
- If you are going to implement a change yourself, do not open an issue for it first. Open the pull request directly. For a new feature or a larger change, start a discussion in [Discussions](https://github.com/haesol-shin/hermes-taskwatch/discussions) before you write code, so the approach is agreed.
- If an issue for the change already exists, link it from the pull request.

## Development

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```sh
uv sync --locked
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format --check
uv run pytest
uv run python scripts/check_review_docs.py
```

CI runs the same commands. A pull request must pass all of them.

## Code style

- Python 3.11 or later, no runtime dependencies.
- Checks are pure functions. Config and state are frozen dataclasses. No inheritance.
- Keep changes minimal and focused. One function does one thing.
- Tests must fail when the behavior they cover breaks.
- Comments explain why, not what.
- Ruff rules `E`, `F`, `I`, `C901` (max complexity 15), line length 100.

## Commits

A commit message explains why the code is the way it is. The diff already shows what changed, so write only what the diff cannot tell a future reader.

- Title: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), `type(scope): summary` in the imperative, in English, 72 characters or fewer (about 50 is best). No trailers.
- Body: why the code is the way it is. There is no limit on the number of lines or bullets.
  - Required: the problem or the reason for the change.
  - Only when useful: a rejected alternative, when another approach looks more natural (`Rejected: ...`).
  - Only when the title and the diff do not show it: the new behavior, described as behavior, not as a file list.
  - Each line is 72 characters or fewer.
- Do not list files, restate the diff, describe the review process, or paste test results. Test results, review and known limits go in the pull request.
- The job runner checks these rules for the commits of a job's pull request units: title shape and length, one blank line after the title, lines of 72 characters or fewer, no trailer lines. A failure goes back to the worker like any failed check.

Example:

```
fix(jobs): reject a review of an older result

A pass on an earlier commit could deliver a result that changed later.
The runner compares the reviewed fingerprint with the current one.
Rejected: warn only, because delivery would already go ahead.
```

## Pull requests

Pull request titles use the same `type(scope): summary` format as commit titles.

The pull request body is the evidence for merging this change now: tests run, CI, review, linked issue if any, and known limits. It stays on GitHub and is reached through the `#number` in the commit title.

- Fill in the pull request template. If an issue exists, link it with `Closes #`.
- Add one line under `Unreleased` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) when the change is visible to users.
- Do not commit secrets, personal values, or local paths. Use placeholders in examples.
- Merging:
  - Every pull request is squash merged, so `main` has one commit per pull request. Write the squash subject as the pull request title plus `(#number)` and the body by the commit rules above, replacing GitHub's commit list. Merge commits and rebase merging are off: a pull request is one change, and its step commits stay on the pull request page.
  - Split a large change into pull requests that can each be reviewed and merged on their own ([Google, Small CLs](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html)).
  - Merge only after the maintainer approves the current head, and pin it: `gh pr merge <number> --match-head-commit <approved SHA>`. A new commit after approval needs a new approval.

## Using AI tools

AI tools are welcome. You are responsible for what you submit:

- Check the result and attach evidence (test output, logs, or the review that found no issues).
- Make sure you can explain the change and maintain it.
