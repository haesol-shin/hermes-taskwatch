"""Run one step of a job: a work or fix session, the deterministic check, or a fresh review.

One service runs one step and exits. Stage changes are compare-and-set on the attempt and
the step's stage under the state lock, so output of an old attempt cannot change a job.
A step that fails without a routed outcome records the error and leaves the stage, so the
scan resumes it. Nothing here calls a model except the omp RPC sessions of work, fix and review.
