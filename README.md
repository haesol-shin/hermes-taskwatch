# hermes-taskwatch

A job runner for approved agent work. It schedules each job, runs it through omp's public RPC, checks the result with plain code, requests an independent review, and delivers the outcome. A person is asked only when judgment is needed.

## What it is not

- It does not import or patch Hermes Agent. Hermes can submit jobs and watch them through the `taskwatch` command, as any caller can.
- It does not approve work. Every job carries an approval record that the caller asserts; the runner cannot authenticate the conversation it came from.
- It does not isolate what the runner's tools can read or write. Those tools have the user's permissions, and `approval_scope` is a recorded boundary, not operating-system isolation.
- It does not merge or apply results.
- Every check is plain code and never calls a model. Work, fixes, and independent reviews use omp.

## How a job runs

A job is a JSON document with a prompt, an intent file, a spec file, required outputs, a check command, a checklist, and the review profile (`code`, `design`, or `source`). A review-only job names a `review_target` instead and skips work and check.

1. **Submit.** `submit` returns after the job and its copied inputs are durable. The receipt key deduplicates retries.
2. **Work.** `scan` reserves a free parallel slot and starts a transient user systemd service that runs omp in the job workspace. The job keeps its slot across work, check, review, and fixes.
3. **Check.** The runner runs the job's `check_command` and records its exit code and output. Required outputs, progress, and a nonempty passing checklist must also exist. A model's PASS claim does not replace these.
4. **Review.** A separate omp session reviews the current result against the intent and spec, using the guidelines in [docs/review](docs/review/README.md). It returns one verdict line. A FAIL or a blocking finding starts a fix, up to three automatic rounds per cycle; then the job stops for user judgment.
5. **Delivery.** A job that passes check and review stops at `deliver_pending`. The next `scan` runs the configured `deliver_command`. Only a recorded success makes the job `done`, and it is never sent again. Any other outcome stops at `user_wait` with `delivery_unknown`; the user can `resume` for one new send or `cancel`.

Jobs that share a target folder cannot overlap; code jobs each have their own worktree and can. Approval and user-judgment waits release their slots after the service has stopped. Dead runs, stalls, and reboot interruptions are recovered after the old service is known to have stopped; three failed recoveries in a row stop for user judgment.

Details: [checks](docs/checks.md) and [configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Work folder lifecycle

A `code` job works in `state/jobs/<id>/worktree` on its own branch, started from a freshly fetched `origin/<default branch>`. Its checklist and progress files live in the job folder, outside the result. When the job reaches `done` or `cancelled`, the scan removes a clean worktree, keeps a dirty one and records why, and deletes the branch only after it is merged or squash merged into `origin/<default branch>`. Job folders, records, reviews, and logs are never deleted. See [code job work folders](docs/configuration.md#code-job-work-folders).

## Install

Requires Linux with user systemd, Python 3.11 or later, git, and an omp executable. There are no runtime dependencies. macOS and Windows are not supported.

From a checkout, run `uv sync --locked`, then use `uv run taskwatch`. The examples below assume the virtual environment is active.

1. `taskwatch --root <root> init` writes `<root>/taskwatch/jobs-config.json`. Edit it, including `omp_command` and `deliver_command`; the draft `deliver_command` cannot send.
2. `taskwatch --root <root> init --unit-dir <empty-dir>` stages the scan service and timer without installing them. Install them into `~/.config/systemd/user/`, run `systemctl --user daemon-reload`, then `systemctl --user enable --now hermes-taskwatch-scan.timer`.
3. Submit jobs with `submit`.

See [installation](docs/configuration.md#installation) for the full steps. To remove, disable and delete the two units; the state directory is kept.

## Configuration

Every key, the submission format, delivery, and recovery are in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Commands

```sh
taskwatch --root <root> init [--unit-dir <dir>]    # write config; stage timer units
taskwatch --root <root> submit <job.json>          # store an approved job
taskwatch --root <root> scan                       # schedule job steps once
taskwatch --root <root> run <job> --attempt <n>    # one reserved step; started by scan
taskwatch --root <root> show [<job>]               # print job state
taskwatch --root <root> watch <job>                # block until the job needs attention
taskwatch --root <root> cancel <job> --reason <text>
taskwatch --root <root> wait <job> --reason <text>   # park the job for approval
taskwatch --root <root> approve <job> --reason <text> [--scope <text>]
taskwatch --root <root> resume <job> --reason <text> # open a new recovery or fix cycle
```

`--root` defaults to `HERMES_HOME`, then `~/.hermes`. `watch` exits `0` when the job needs attention, `3` when its own `--timeout` passes, `2` on a usage error or unknown job, and `1` on another error. `run` is started by `scan`; do not run it alongside the service.

## Limits

- A delivery success means the command reported acceptance, not that the person read the message.
- A delivery whose outcome is unknown is never resent automatically.
- The runner does not reconcile external outcomes.
- Work, fix, and review quality depend on omp and its model; the checks cover only what code can verify.
