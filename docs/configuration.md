# Configuration and state

The `taskwatch` command never imports Hermes. `--root <root>` selects the root
explicitly; otherwise `HERMES_HOME`, then `~/.hermes`, is used. Select the shared
root, not a worker profile root. All state lives under `<root>/taskwatch/`; records
share the lock `<root>/taskwatch/state/lock`.
Use persistent, nonsynchronized storage for operational state. Temporary
directories are suitable only for synthetic tests.

## Job config

`taskwatch --root <root> init` writes `taskwatch/jobs-config.json` if absent:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "slots": 2,
  "stall_seconds": 1800,
  "omp_command": ["omp"],
  "rpc_timeout": 3600,
  "deliver_command": ["false", "{message}"]
}
```

All keys shown above are required. The three numeric settings are positive integer counts
or seconds. `omp_command` is an argument list prefix. Checks use the submission's
`check_command`, not this model command. `deliver_command` is described in
[Delivery](#delivery). The draft value
`["false", "{message}"]` is intentionally disabled: it can never send, so edit it before use.

Optionally add `"review_command": ["executor", "--role", "reviewer"]` to run
independent reviews with a different command prefix. Like `omp_command`, it must
be a nonempty list of nonempty strings. When omitted, reviews use `omp_command`;
work and fix always use `omp_command`. Both commands receive `--mode rpc --no-ui`.
The `init` draft omits this optional key.

In `review_command` (and only there), an argument that is exactly `{guidelines}` becomes the
job's own copy of the review guidelines, and exactly `{review}` becomes the job's `review`
value. That lets the review command be the [reviewer launcher](review-launch.md), which
reads the agent definition and those guidelines when the review starts:

```json
"review_command": ["python3", "-m", "taskwatch.reviewer_launch", "--agent", "/srv/example/reviewer.md",
                   "--guidelines", "{guidelines}", "--review", "{review}"]
```

### Job environment

Optionally add `"env"`, an object of string keys and string values, to set the environment of
every process the runner starts for a job: the omp worker (work, fix, review, including the
reviewer command), the check command, and the git commands the runner runs. A systemd job
starts with a minimal `PATH`, so tools such as `gitleaks` in `~/.local/bin` or `omp` plugins in
`~/.bun/bin` are missing for a commit hook until you add them here. Values are used as written,
except in `PATH`, where `~` and `$HOME` expand and `$PATH` stands for the inherited value. No
shell runs. Anything that is not an object of strings is a config error; omitting `env` or
leaving it empty keeps the inherited environment. The `init` draft omits this key.

```json
"env": {"PATH": "~/.local/bin:~/.bun/bin:$PATH"}
```

### Code job work folders

A `code` job that builds a result works in `state/jobs/<id>/worktree`, on its own branch.

- Base. Before the worktree is created, the runner runs `git fetch origin <default branch>`
  without prompting and with a 5 second cap. The default branch is the one `origin/HEAD`
  names, or `main`. The worktree starts at `origin/<default branch>`. If the fetch fails or the
  target has no `origin`, the local ref is used and the job records `base_note: "base may be
  stale: <reason>"`. The optional submission field `base` (a commit or branch of the target)
  replaces the base, for work stacked on another job's branch; it is used as written, with no
  fetch. Afterwards `base` in the record is the commit used.
- Branch. `<branch_prefix><first 8 characters of the job id>`. Optionally add
  `"branch_prefix"` to `jobs-config.json` (default `"taskwatch/"`): letters, digits, `_` and
  `-`, with parts joined by `/`. A resumed job reuses its worktree and branch.
- Cleanup. When a job reaches `done` or `cancelled`, and not at `deliver_pending`, the scan runs
  `git worktree remove` without `--force`. A folder with uncommitted or untracked files, or
  that git refuses to remove, stays and `workspace_state` says why (`kept: <reason>`); the scan
  retries it. The job folder, records, reviews and logs are never deleted.
- Branch deletion. After a fetch, the branch is deleted only when it is integrated: its tip is
  in the history of `origin/<default branch>`, or merging it onto that branch changes nothing
  (a squash merge already holds its content). Otherwise `branch_state` stays `kept` and the
  scan checks again later. `integrated` means integrated but git refused the deletion. The
  integration check needs git 2.38 or later (`git merge-tree --write-tree`); on an older git
  only a branch in the history is deleted.
- Record fields: `base`, `base_note`, `branch`, `workspace_state` (`active`, `removed`,
  `kept: <reason>`) and `branch_state` (`kept`, `integrated`, `deleted`), shown by
  `taskwatch show`. Records from before these fields exist keep their detached worktree and are
  not cleaned up.

### Job records

A job keeps its checklist and progress files in its job folder (`state/jobs/<id>/`), next to
the logs and reviews, not in the workspace. The worker prompt and `WORKFLOW.md` give their
absolute paths. The records are therefore never part of a result, and the clean-tree check of a
`code` job needs no exception. A job submitted earlier whose paths name `.taskwatch/...` still
loads; those paths now resolve inside the job folder as well.

### Submit an approved job

Pass a JSON file to `taskwatch --root <root> submit <file>`. Example:

```json
{
  "receipt_key": "approval-message-1:job-1",
  "approval_source": "approval-message-1",
  "approval_scope": "Create local deliverables only",
  "prompt": "Write the approved deliverable and record execution evidence.",
  "review": "source",
  "target": "/srv/example-target",
  "intent": "/srv/example-inputs/intent.md",
  "spec": "/srv/example-inputs/spec.md",
  "inputs": {
    "work": ["/srv/example-inputs/context.md"],
    "review": ["/srv/example-inputs/review-context.md"]
  },
  "outputs": ["result.md"],
  "check_command": ["sh", "check-result.sh"],
  "checklist": "checklist.json",
  "progress": "progress.md",
  "predecessors": [],
  "expected_wait_seconds": 0,
  "approval_required": false
}
```

`target` must exist. `review` picks the review guidelines the reviewer reads: `code`,
`design`, or `source` (a document that cites sources, such as research notes, summaries,
or comparisons). Only `code` also runs the work in a Git worktree, because a code review
reads the Git diff.
Output paths are relative to the job workspace, checklist and progress paths to the job
folder; none can traverse outside its base. `check_command` runs as argv without an implicit
shell; name a shell explicitly only when the approved check needs one.
The work must create that check script if it is not already in its workspace.
The checklist follows the existing nonempty `items` list of boolean `passes`.

`inputs`, `predecessors`, `expected_wait_seconds`, and `approval_required` are
optional. Every other example field is required. Predecessors must already
exist. Derive the receipt key from the approval message and its job number.
A repeated key returns the original job even if other arguments differ.
The command records the caller's approval assertion; it cannot authenticate
the conversation.

`approval_required` defaults to `false`. If `true`, the first scan moves the job
to `approval_wait` before its first work run. `approve` clears that flag and
allows work to start. A later `wait` records the current step for approval.

`approval_scope` is a recorded boundary, not operating-system isolation.
The runner's shell tools have the user's permissions; instructions and
explicit approval records cannot enforce those permissions.

Code jobs that build a result accept an optional `public_text` list for the pull
requests the job produces. Each unit is `{"id": "pr1", "base": "<ref>", "head": "HEAD"}`;
`head` defaults to `HEAD`, and `id` is lowercase letters, digits and hyphens. For a
stacked series the `base` of a unit is the `head` of the one before. A `base` must
resolve in `target` at submit unless it is another unit's `head`; refs are resolved
again in the work folder at every check. The worker writes `pr/<id>/title.txt` and
`pr/<id>/body.md` in the job folder, never in the work folder. The check fails when a
file is missing, a unit has no commits, or a commit message breaks the common rules:
title is `type(scope): summary` or `type: summary` and at most 72 characters, one blank
line follows the title, no line is longer than 72 characters, no trailer line
(`Co-authored-by:`, `Signed-off-by:` and similar). There is no limit on bullets.

The check command must exit `0`. Required outputs and a nonempty passing
checklist must also exist after the command finishes. Minimal checklist:

```json
{"items": [{"passes": true}]}
```

No other checklist item fields are required. A `false` item, missing file,
invalid JSON, or empty list blocks progress. The independent reviewer returns
exactly one verdict JSON line followed by findings, for example:

```text
{"verdict": "PASS", "blocking": false, "reviewer": "independent-review"}
No blocking findings.
```

A FAIL, malformed verdict, missing input, or blocking finding prevents
`deliver_pending`. See [review records](checks.md#review-records) for the shared contract.

Submission copies and hashes intent, spec, and role-specific inputs. The
original prompt is kept intact. `jobs.jsonl` stores append-only, checksummed
snapshots. The existing torn-tail repair preserves a partial last line before
the next append. Corrupt committed records block scheduling rather than
letting a job start or pass. Inspect the scan service journal for diagnostics.

Each job has `state/jobs/<id>/`, a separate workspace, copied inputs, a
`WORKFLOW.md`, and execution evidence. Code jobs use a git worktree on their own
branch; see [Code job work folders](#code-job-work-folders). This command does not merge or
apply results.

#### Review-only jobs

Replace `outputs`, `check_command`, `checklist`, and `progress` with one `review_target` to
review something that already exists. There is no work stage and no check; the job starts at
the review step, in the target directory itself.

```json
{
  "receipt_key": "approval-message-1:review-1",
  "approval_source": "approval-message-1",
  "approval_scope": "Review only; change nothing",
  "prompt": "Review this change against the intent and the spec.",
  "review": "code",
  "target": "/srv/example-repo",
  "intent": "/srv/example-inputs/intent.md",
  "spec": "/srv/example-inputs/spec.md",
  "review_target": {"commit": "HEAD"}
}
```

`review_target` is exactly one of `{"files": ["relative/path"]}` (files under `target`) or
`{"commit": "<revision>"}` (resolved to a full SHA when the job is submitted). `inputs`,
`predecessors`, `expected_wait_seconds`, and `approval_required` work as for other jobs.

The verdict is the result. A parsed `PASS` or `FAIL` is recorded and delivered; a `FAIL` does
not start a fix, because there is nothing to fix. An answer with no acceptable verdict line, or a
target that changed during the review, costs a round and reviews again. The cap is the one other jobs have: the first review plus three
retries, four reviews in all; after that the job stops for user judgment (`review_exhausted`). The review record and
job state are in `show <id>`.

### Timer entry point

Install the scan timer with the units that `init` stages; see
[Installation](#installation). Keep the five-minute timer schedule.

`taskwatch --root <root> init --unit-dir <empty-unit-staging-directory>` writes
`hermes-taskwatch-scan.service` and `.timer` without installing, reloading, or
enabling them. Existing files are refused. The service calls the standalone
`scan` with the current interpreter and explicit root. Inspect the staged files
and replace the existing service only as part of an approved installation.
Run `systemctl --user daemon-reload` after installing it. Confirm the timer is
enabled and active, and confirm linger with `loginctl show-user <user> -p Linger`
if jobs must survive logout. Run these installation steps only on the intended
host with approval.

`scan` is a short scheduler, not a resident dispatcher. It reserves the job
attempt durably before invoking `systemd-run --user`. The deterministic
`taskwatch-<id>-a<attempt>.service` name allows a later scan to find a start
whose acknowledgement was lost. `taskwatch run <id> --attempt <n>` is an
internal step command; do not run it alongside the service.

### Installation

Do these steps in order on the intended host. Stop at the first failure.

1. If `<root>/taskwatch/jobs-config.json` already exists, add `deliver_command` to it before running `init` (see [Delivery](#delivery)); `init` validates existing config without changing it. Fresh installations can keep the init-then-edit order below.
2. Stage the units: `taskwatch --root <root> init --unit-dir <empty-unit-staging-directory>`. This also writes `jobs-config.json` if absent. Nothing is installed or enabled.
3. Edit `<root>/taskwatch/jobs-config.json`, including `deliver_command` (see [Delivery](#delivery)).
4. Inspect the staged `hermes-taskwatch-scan.service` and `.timer`, install them into `~/.config/systemd/user/`, then run `systemctl --user daemon-reload`.
5. Enable the timer with `systemctl --user enable --now hermes-taskwatch-scan.timer`. Confirm it is enabled and active, and confirm linger with `loginctl show-user <user> -p Linger` if jobs must survive logout.
6. Submit jobs with `taskwatch --root <root> submit <approved-job.json>`.

### Delivery

The `init` draft sets `deliver_command` to `["false", "{message}"]`, which
intentionally cannot send. An attempt with this draft stops for user judgment,
so replace it before enabling the timer.

`jobs-config.json` requires `deliver_command`: a list of nonempty strings run as
argv without a shell. Exactly one argument must be the whole string `{message}`;
it is replaced with the absolute path of the generated message file. The
destination is a literal argument written in this command, not the job's
`target` (a workspace path). Example, with a synthetic destination:

```json
"deliver_command": ["hermes", "send", "--to", "discord:#synthetic-channel", "--file", "{message}", "--json"]
```

Choose a configured Hermes target with `hermes send --list`.

Hermes is optional. Without it, provide a sender executable for your channel and
configure its argv instead, for example
`["notify-command", "--to", "person.invalid", "--file", "{message}"]`.
The sender must wait for the channel server's response and implement this contract:
stdout must contain exactly one JSON object, with no diagnostic text around it.
Write diagnostics to stderr. Both streams and the exit code are recorded.
For example, exit 0 with `{"success": true, "message_id": "synthetic-message"}`
confirms sending. Every other outcome is unknown, including a nonzero exit with
a readable JSON `error`: a timeout or partial send may already have delivered content.

For a job at `deliver_pending`, `scan` runs this step under the state lock after
the old unit has been released. It writes `delivery.txt` (title from the first
prompt line, job id, latest review verdict, absolute output paths, result
workspace, review body file, and check log path) and `delivery-review.txt` in the
job folder, records the attempt as `started` with the message file and the
SHA-256 of `delivery.txt`, then runs the command with a fixed 60 second timeout.

Before sending, the result fingerprint, declared output content digest, and review
basis must match the accepted PASS. The output digest also covers Git-ignored files.
Changed, missing, or unreadable evidence returns to `check`, spending the existing
recovery budget; exhaustion stops at `user_wait/result_unstable`.

After scheduling work and result deliveries, each scan sends one short stop
notice for every new `user_wait` or `approval_wait` entry through the same
`deliver_command`, timeout, and success contract. `notice-<index>.txt` names the
job, first prompt line, stage, wait reason, error, and resume/approve/cancel
commands. Attempts are reserved in `notices` under the state lock before sending.
The sender runs without that lock; only its notice result is merged into the latest
snapshot, so unrelated jobs can finish while it waits. No outcome causes an automatic
retry or changes the stage. Interrupted attempts become unknown.
`delivery_unknown` receives a separate notice, never a result resend.

For result delivery, success needs exit code 0, a JSON object with a truthy
`success`, no `error`, and a present `message_id`. Then the job becomes `done` and is never sent again.
Success means the command reported acceptance; it is not a read receipt. A
response with only `skipped` is unknown, not done.

- Every non-confirmed outcome (including a readable `error`, timeout, unreadable
  output, signal, ambiguous response, or an earlier attempt still `started`)
  moves the job to `user_wait` with reason `delivery_unknown`. It is never resent
  automatically. Hermes provides neither lookup nor an idempotency key.
- `resume <id>` restores `deliver_pending` for one new send and keeps the attempt
  history; an interrupted `started` attempt is recorded as unknown. Resume only
  when a duplicate message is explicitly accepted, because the earlier message
  may have been delivered. `cancel` prevents further sends.

### Watching a job

`taskwatch --root <root> watch <job-id> [--timeout <seconds>] [--interval <seconds>]` blocks
until the job stage is `approval_wait`, `user_wait`, `deliver_pending`, `done`, or
`cancelled`, prints a report of at most 20 lines (id, stage, `wait_reason`, whether an `error` is recorded (its text is not printed), last
review verdict, output and detail paths, next commands), and exits. It exits at once when the
job already stopped. Exit codes: `0` needs attention, `3` the `--timeout` (default 82800)
passed with nothing to report, `2` usage error or unknown job, `1` other error. `--interval`
defaults to 30 and is at least 5. The command is read only: it takes no lock and writes
nothing. It reads `jobs.jsonl` once, then only the lines appended since the last poll, because
a full load of a large ledger takes about a second. Hermes starts it from the room that
submitted the job:

```python
terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True, command="taskwatch --root <root> watch <id>")
```

The report is a hint; re-read the state with `show` before acting. `approve` and `resume`
move the job to `queued`, so a watcher started after them waits for the next stop.

### Recovery and decisions

The job retains its parallel slot through work, checks, review, and fixes.
A job that works in a shared folder (a non-code job, or a review-only job) locks its target
across these stages; a code job that builds a result does not, because its worktree is its
own (see [Code job work folders](#code-job-work-folders)). A blocked predecessor leaves
the successor queued. An unrelated target can still start.
Dead or reboot-interrupted runs resume only after the old service is known
to have stopped. An unknown service outcome requires user judgment.
Unchanged progress and output content first produces a stall suspicion;
another unchanged scan stops the service and recovers. Log growth alone is
not progress. Expected waits delay stall recovery.

Three consecutive failed recoveries stop for user judgment. Passing checks
reset that recovery budget. The independent review has a separate per-cycle
cap of three automatic fix rounds. A fresh review uses `docs/review/` profiles
and the existing verdict JSON contract. Fingerprints and review basis are
computed by code; changing either invalidates the earlier pass.

```sh
taskwatch --root <root> wait <id> --reason "Unapproved external write"
taskwatch --root <root> approve <id> --reason "approval-message-2" --scope "Exact approved scope"
taskwatch --root <root> resume <id> --reason "Approved a new fix cycle"
taskwatch --root <root> cancel <id> --reason "User cancelled"
```

Wait and cancel fence late output immediately. The scanner confirms service
termination before reusing the slot or target. Approval resumes the saved step;
an explicit user resume opens a new recovery/fix cycle. Resuming a review fix
reserves its first round before launch. Check repairs keep the separate recovery
budget. Commands do not send messages themselves; scans send results and stop
notices. The runner does not reconcile an external outcome.

`approve --scope` records a replacement approved scope together with the approval
source. Omit it to preserve the original scope, such as an initial approval wait.
Do not use a broader scope than the user actually approved.

After checks and review pass, the stage is `deliver_pending`, not `done`; see
[Delivery](#delivery).
