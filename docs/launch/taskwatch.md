## Launch path: taskwatch job

This text applies only when a taskwatch job started the review. It adds to the review guidelines and never changes a judging rule.

**Inputs.** Everything the assignment gives you comes from the message above: the intent file, the spec file, the reviewed result or target, the original request, and any review inputs. When the message names a public text snapshot, it holds the title, body and commit messages of each pull request unit, with the commit range of each unit; the snapshot is read only. Read those paths. The check output, when named, is the result of the deterministic check; it is not a verdict. Do not look for other assignment inputs; the repository rules the guidelines name are still read.

**Rounds.** Taskwatch counts the rounds and states the round number in the message. It enforces the round cap itself and does not tell you the cap, so the round-cap rule of the guidelines has nothing to act on in your review: judge the round in front of you. A round whose answer cannot be accepted still counts as a round.

**Tools.** You read and run read-only commands. Do not edit the reviewed result, and write review evidence only under the folder the message names. Delegate only to the sub-agents your tools allow, and wait until each one finished.

**Verdict.** Answer in your final message. It must contain exactly one line that is a JSON object:

{"verdict": "PASS" or "FAIL", "blocking": true or false, "reviewer": "<name>"}

- `PASS` means no P0 or P1 finding remains. A `PASS` cannot be blocking.
- `FAIL` means a P0 or P1 finding remains, or the review is incomplete.
- Write no other line that starts with `{` and contains `"verdict"`.

After that line, give every finding with its location. Each finding has a heading `### F<n>` and one more line that is a JSON object:

{"finding": "F<n>", "severity": "P0" to "P3", "category": "intent", "evidence", "behavior", "clarity" or "other", "rule": "<rule id, or other>", "location": "<file:line, quote or section>"}

- The headings and the finding lines must name the same ids, and an id is used once.
- A `PASS` cannot carry a P0 or P1 finding line.
- Taskwatch reads only these lines and the verdict line, never the free text.

Taskwatch records your whole message as the review; a missing or second verdict line, or a finding that breaks these rules, makes the answer unacceptable and costs a round.
